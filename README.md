This is just my Voting app that I made as a project for my college, So I don't really mind this code being used as a reference for something, something else, But Please
### PLEASE DO NOT COPY THE CODE AND USE IT FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE ###
That is all, This is one of my first actual beginner's project in C and there are bound to be many problems found within it and it could also be written more efficiently,
So, I am always ready to hear your suggestion.

*** If the project doesn't work for you, Make the txt files from the first 10 lines of the program or you can modify it. ***

THANK YOU
